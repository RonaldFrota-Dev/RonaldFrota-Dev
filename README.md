# Ronald Symon Frota e Frota

**`Game Designer`**
**`Unreal Programmer`**

My name is Ronald Symon Frota e Frota, I'm 24 years old and hold a degree in **Software Engineering**.
I’m currently seeking opportunities to put my skills to the test in the professional market.
My main focus is game development — a field that combines technology, design, and storytelling, constantly challenging me to think as both a creator and a player.
I work with **Unreal Engine**, using both **BPs** and **C++**, and have been deepening my knowledge in **game design** and **narrative writing** to craft engaging and meaningful experiences.
I also share my knowledge and learning process through videos on my *personal* YouTube channel
